### I’m a QA Engineer 🔍

I love convenient and high-quality services, so I do my best to create them like that. I use my knowledge and skills in test design and testing.

For me, my job is not simply about making test cases and bug reports. I make every effort to ensure that bug fixes are deployed to production and users are satisfied with the quality of the service. I participate in design of new features, improve usability.

I would like to work on a socially-significant product, which helps people. I am interested in professional growing, learning new skills and using them on practice.

**Skills**
Test Analysis, Test Design, UI testing, API testing, HTTP, Postman, Charles/Fiddler, Chrome DevTools, SQL, Bash, Atlassian Jira

**Also**
I love 📷 digital photography and photo processing. I like music and play the 🎹 piano.

I would be happy to join a company that makes products in these areas as a QA Engineer!
